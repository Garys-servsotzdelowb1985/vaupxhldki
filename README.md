Just walked out of Chasing the Wind. Wow, my head’s swimming or tangled, like someone played the piano all wrong on my brain. Anyway, sat here on this sticky bench, god, still got popcorn crumbs on my shirt. The theater was packed, people rustling, laughing awkwardly during the sad parts, ugh, my back is killing me. So, the movie...

Characters felt like, I dunno, old friends you forgot you missed. There was this scene, where the protagonist, what's his name—Mr. Tall Hair—was running through a field. Man, was like one of those dreams where you’re late but wildly poetic in a way. Mist was everywhere but the mist kinda looked CGI-y, like a half-baked cake, know what I mean? Not saying that’s bad. Maybe they did it on purpose.

The plot? Twisty, like a cat chasing its tail. Some lines sucked like a black hole, not even light could escape their awkwardness. But mostly it felt like music, like chords jumping between emotions. That lady character, the one with the diary, had that greenhouse scene. My allergies played a crazy drum solo in my head.

> Download the movie, or just watch the movie if you can, someone said it’s the kind of film that grows on you like ivy. Or maybe like a fungus. Both are kinda true, in different ways.

Yeah, there was this bit with the bird (why always birds?)—oh, right, surrealism, I guess. And water, water dripping, almost like a bad tap faucet. The sound though, amazing, like a symphony orchestra trying to tune up. Made my tired spine hum, or maybe that was the backache kicking in. But then, a tune with a love story hiding in it, like a song you forget the lyrics to but remember the feeling.

That ending!! God, if I say anything more, some movie spoiler law will probably arrest me. there was a whisper, like a secret the movie shared just with me. I should've kept a note but who brings note pads to movies?

Random – was there a rooster noise? Or just noisy kids in theater? Hard to tell now. Like mixing flavors of ice cream on a sunburnt tongue. Halfway I thought, geez, I need to learn how to fly a kite, but movies do that to ya.

Time to head back now. Gonna hit play again in my dreams tonight, I bet or just glitch through it like a bad internet stream, you ever think dreams are just crappy downloads of our day? Anyway.

Accidentally pasted code thought I was testing earlier, here, dunno:

```csharp
void WhatsGoingOn()
{
    int clueless = 0;
    while (true)
    {
        clueless++;
        if (clueless > 10)
        break;
    }
}
```

See what I mean, no idea. Time for a coffee, maybe two.
